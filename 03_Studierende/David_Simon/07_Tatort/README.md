##To do

In case someone (probably me) has to work one this again, this is a list of things left todo:
 - SVG/PNG fallback for logo
 - Check cross/backwards-compat for css-element-queries. (IE8+ it say - true?)
 - Check backwards-compat for css-only repsonsive navigation `checkbox + next-el`
 - Header image resolution serve different versions depending on screen size (ultra, large, medium, small)
 - Serve other images the same way? Get four versions from server, serve correct one.
 - Use a single icon for responsive nav instead of using the whole font-awesome set jsut for one icon.
 - Refactor main.scss and split into multiple files
