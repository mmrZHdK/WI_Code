Commands:


1) cd

Cd is short for change directory. This will change the current directory to the directory specified. To access the “Desktop” directory, type:

cd Desktop

Hit return to execute the command (do this every time to execute each command line).

To return to your home directory, type:

cd ~

But for now let’s keep the path to the “Desktop” (cd Desktop).


2) mkdir

Mkdir is short for make directory (make folder). To make a test directory, type:

mkdir test


3) pwd

Pwd displays the path of the current directory. Type:

pwd

will display something like this:

/Users/alex/Desktop


4) cp

Cp is short for copy. To copy the “test.txt” file inside of the “test” directory on the “Desktop”, type:

cp /Users/alex/Desktop/test.txt test/test2.txt

This placed a copy of the “test.txt” file inside the “test” directory and named it “test2.txt”.

Notice after the command “cp” we type “pathdir+old name” space, than “dir+new name”.

Change (cd) directory to the “test” directory (see above for help).


5) ls
Ls is short for list. Ls will list files in a directory. Type:
ls
or ls -a
to list all (including hidden files)


6) mv

Mv will change the name of a file. From the test directory type:

mv test2.txt test3.txt

Notice after the command “mv” we type “old name” space, than “new name”. Type “ls” to check if it worked.


7) rm

Rm is short for remove (delete). To remove the “test3.txt” file inside the current directory type:

rm test3.txt

Or remove a folder with or without items in side

sudo rm -rf /path/folder_name


8) man

Man is short for manual. For example to display the manual for “rm” type:

man rm

This will display information about the “rm” command. You can type any command after “man” to access additional information on that topic.


9) “Q” key

Q is short for quit. To escape the manual screen, hit the “Q” key:
