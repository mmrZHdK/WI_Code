Description: \
\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 Tatort is a long-standing show, with high popularity in German-speaking regions. It shares similarities with many American criminal series. However, its style stands at the opposite of the scale of American franchise: subtle, ordinary personnel, much less bloody. This different type of "hero" is worthy to be introduced to wider audience, Even brief impressions could place a note against the overwhelming American style.\
\
The new layout aims to keep the true fans, but also raise curiosities from "outsiders", referring to anyone does not know the show or non-fans. I divided the site into three parts: Snapshot, Archive and Community. The focus of this project are the front page and Snapshot part. It intends to allure visitors go deeper into the site through strong images and simple layout.\
